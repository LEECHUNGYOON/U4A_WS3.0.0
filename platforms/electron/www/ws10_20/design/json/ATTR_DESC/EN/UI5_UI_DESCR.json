Examples: 12 hours. labelling format: time formats for the upper row and lower row in the time line. These two rows do not have to share the same format.  range: defines a certain length in pixel. Gantt Chart loops the granularity levels from the beginning and chooses the first granularity level with the time span that consumes more than the defined length. For example, if the current range is 90, Gantt Chart loops the granularity levels from the default initial granularity level 5min. If the 6hour granularity level consumes 50 pixels, 12hour consumes 100 pixels, and 1Day consumes 200 pixels, the 12hour granularity level is selected as the current granularity level as it's the first level with the time span that consumes more than 90 pixels. \n\nThe granularity level is a JSON object with the granularity as the key and some internal information such as formatting.\n\nTake the \"12hour\" granularity level for example.  \"12hour\": - Granularity level ID.   \"innerInterval\" - Time interval between neighboring vertical lines is 12 hours.  \"unit\": sap.gantt.config.TimeUnit.day - Time unit is day. \"span\": 1 - Span is 1. \"range\": 90 - This granularity level is selected as the current level if 12 hours is the first time span that consumes more than 90 pixels to be displayed in the chart area.    largeInterval - Time interval of the upper row in the timeline is 1 day. Formatted in the locale language with the format string. This zoom level implements an interval larger than the interval in the default zoom level.  \"unit\": sap.gantt.config.TimeUnit.day Time unit is day.  \"span\": 1 - Time span is 1. \"format\": \"cccc dd.M.yyyy\" - Formats the string in CLDR date/time symbols. \"pattern\": \"yyyy\" -Aa data pattern in LDML format. This setting takes precedence over the setting of \"format\". \"relativeTime\": true - Specifies whether or not to use relative time mode, which defaults to \"false\". When you set this property to \"true\", Gantt Chart ignores the values of \"format\" and \"pattern\". In this mode, if the largeInterval or the smallInterval of the timeline option uses the \"sap.gantt.config.TimeUnit.day\" or \"sap.gantt.config.TimeUnit.week\" unit, you must set the span to 1. \"relativeTimePrefix\": \"Day\" - A string that specifies the prefix displayed before every relative time point. For example, if you set this property to \"Day\", the relative timeline will display \"Day 1\", \"Day 2\", \"Day 3\", and so on so forth.    smallInterval - Time interval of the lower row in the timeline is 12 hours.

This zoom level implements an interval the same as the that of the default zoom level.  \"unit\": sap.gantt.config.TimeUnit.hour - Time unit is hour. \"span\": 2 - Time span is 2. \"format\": \"HH:mm\" - Formats the string in CLDR date/time symbols. \"relativeTime\": false     \n\nThe current granularity setting provides the following values in the default time line option: 5min, 10min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, 2hour, 4hour, 6hour, 12hour, 1day, 2day, 4day, 1week, 2week, 1month, 2month, 4month, 6month, 1year, 2year, 5year.

This property allows three possible values:  true false Strict \n\nBy default, the table is rendered with a fixed layout algorithm (fixedLayout=true). This means the horizontal layout only depends on the table's width and the width of the columns, not the content of the cells. Cells in subsequent rows do not affect column width. This allows a browser to provide a faster table layout since the browser can begin to display the table once the first row has been analyzed.\n\nIf this property is set to false, sap.m.Table is rendered with an auto layout algorithm. This means, the width of the table and its cells depends on the content of the cells. The column width is set by the widest unbreakable content inside the cells. This can make the rendering slow, since the browser needs to go through all the content in the table before determining the final layout.\n\nIf this property is set to Strict and the width property is defined for all columns (and not the expected \"auto\" value), then the sap.m.Table control renders a placeholder column which occupies the remaining width of the control to ensure the column width setting is strictly applied.\n\nIf there is only one remaining column with a width larger than the table, then this column gets the maximum width available in the table. If the column width is smaller than the table, then the column width is retained, and the remaining width of the table is occupied by the placeholder column.\n\nThe placeholder column gets rendered only if there are no columns in the pop-in area.\n\nNote: Since sap.m.Table does not have its own scrollbars, setting fixedLayout to false can force the table to overflow, which may cause visual problems. It is suggested to use this property when a table has a few columns in wide screens or within the horizontal scroll container (e.g sap.m.Dialog) to handle overflow.

You can use specific CSS sizes (for example, 600px or 600), you can also use the sap.m.ScreenSize enumeration (for example, Phone, Tablet, Desktop, Small, Medium, Large, ....).

Providing more precise MaxLength value for the Edm.String type or precision value for numeric OData types can help this algorithm to produce better results. The calculated column widths can have a minimum of 3rem and a maximum of 20rem.

Column resizing feature gets enabled and the wrapping of column headers get disabled for all columns, including custom columns.  Those properties must not be managed by the application.\n\nBy default, this feature has no effect on custom columns. To enable heuristic column width calculation also for custom columns, the autoColumnWidth property must be specified in the p13nData custom data. Note: The automatic column width calculation for custom columns works only when the width property of the custom column is not set. Note: The custom columns can have unexpected cell templates that might affect the result of the column width calculation, for example, an Edm.Byte field that can only have three digits might be visualized as a sap.m.RatingIndicator that requires more space.

Add a Label control to start a new row ({@link sap.ui.layout.form.FormElement FormElement}). Add controls as input fields, text fields or other as needed. Use LayoutData to influence the layout for special cases in the single controls. For example, if a ColumnLayout is used as a layout, the form content is weighted using 4 cells for the labels and 8 cells for the field part, for large size. If there is only little space, the labels are above the fields and each field uses 12 cells. If your input controls should influence their width, you can add sap.ui.layout.ColumnElementData to them via setLayoutData method. Ensure that the sum of the weights in the ColumnElementData is not more than 12, as this is the total width of the input control part of each form row.  Example for a row where the Input uses 6 cells and the second Input uses 2 cells (using ColumnElementData): \nnew sap.m.Label({text:\"Label\"});\nnew sap.m.Input({value:\"6 cells\", layoutData: new sap.ui.layout.ColumnElementData({cellsLarge: 6, cellsSmall: 8})}),\nnew sap.m.Input({value:\"2 cells\", layoutData: new sap.ui.layout.ColumnElementData({cellsLarge: 2, cellsSmall: 4})}),\n\n\nFor example, if a ResponsiveGridLayout is used as a layout, there are 12 cells in one row. Depending on the screen size the labels use the defined labelSpan. The remaining cells are used for the fields (and emptySpan if defined). The available cells are distributed to all fields in the row. If one field should use a fixed number of cells you can add sap.ui.layout.GridData to them via setLayoutData method. If there are additional fields in the row they will get the remaining cells.  Example for a row with two Input controls where one uses four cells on small screens, one cell on medium screens and 2 cells on larger screens (using ResponsiveGridLayout): \nnew sap.m.Label({text:\"Label\"});\nnew sap.m.Input({value:\"auto size\"}),\nnew sap.m.Input({value:\"fix size\", layoutData: new sap.ui.layout.GridData({span: \"XL1 L1 M2 S4\"})}),\n\n\nWarning: Do not put any layout or other container controls in here. This could damage the visual layout, keyboard support and screen-reader support. Only labels, titles, toolbars and form controls are allowed. Views are also not supported.
